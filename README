cryptokit

CryptoKit aims to provide similar functionality to NaCL[1], while using
FIPS ciphers. It provides the following packages:

* secretbox: secure and authenticate small messages with 20-year security.
* strongbox: secure and authenticate small messages with 50-year security.


Cipher Selection
* secretbox: AES-128 in CTR mode with HMAC-SHA-256
* strongbox: AES-256 in CTR mode with HMAC-SHA-256
