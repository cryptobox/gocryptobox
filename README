cryptokit

CryptoKit aims to provide similar functionality to NaCL[1], while using
FIPS ciphers. It provides the following packages:

* secretbox: secure and authenticate small messages with 20-year security.
* strongbox: secure and authenticate small messages with 50-year security.

cryptokit operates on the concept of "boxes", which are encrypted and
authenticated secure messages. Boxes operate under the following threat model:

* Messages should be confidential, but it is not a concern that Eve can
  determine the length of the message.
* The communicating parties have some means of authenticating keys on
  their own; that is, this package provides no authentication outside
  of the keys themselves. There is no identity bound to a key.
